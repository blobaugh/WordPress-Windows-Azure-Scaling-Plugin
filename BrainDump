- *DONE* Build form
--- *DONE* Don't forget the subscription and certificate info!
- *DONE* Save form items in wp_options

- *DONE* Do a check to see if a class is available, if not load packaged WAZ PHP SDK
- *DONE* Create custom post type for diagnostics
- *DONE* Pull diagnostics from table and place in database
---- *DONE* Code to retrieve from table
---- *DONE* How to create a new post from code?
---- *DONE* Title = Resource: Usage: Instance
- *DONE* Add cron to pull diagnostics from the table and place in db
- *DONE*Retrieve last 15 minutes of diagnostics from database
--- *DONE* Create an array of the useful metric info
--- *DONE* If there are no posts skip the checks
--- *DONE* Function returns data in a usable state - See averages() at https://github.com/Interop-Bridges/Windows-Azure-Sample-Kit-4-PHP/blob/master/dealoftheday_sample/Worker/lib/functions.php
--- *DONE* If data exists check against triggers
- *DONE* Setup scaling code
- *DONE* Hook triggers into scaling code - cron
- *DONE* Add logic to erase crons on deactivate
- *DONE* Add check to see if any options are set. If not tell the user to set them in a message

=== Secondary Tasks ===
- Add checks to cron to ensure the actions are only completed if valid settings are available
- If function_exists(azure_getconfig()) use those values for INITIAL settings
- Add numbers to triggers page
- Convert Deployment Slot on settings page to select menu
- Create code to list crons with prefix
- Create code to manage cron jobs
--- Very generic, should read and write
--- Create ability to check for prefix
- Build form to add schedule rules to cron
--- Possibly save in wp_options and on activate check for the crons and restore them
- Add dashboard widget that shows instance stats
- *DONE* Ensure diagnostics info is getting pulled from the db for only last 15 minutes
- Update settings form with checkboxes for types of triggers the user wants to check
---- Store in wazScale_settings -> wp_options
---- Update triggers from to read from wp_options and only provide fields checked
---- Update wazScale_check_triggers() to only check triggers in wp_options
- Write a more creative admin message if options do not exist
- Checkbox in settings to remove settings on uninstall
- Checkbox in settings to remove diagnostics on uninstall



*************************************************************************************
Anything below this line may not make sense and may not be implemented or implemented
completely different. The following is only a brainstorm dump
*************************************************************************************

== Certificate storage ==
The text for the cert could be stored in the database and the file created on the fly for security

== Plugin Pages ==
- Main page displays stats and allows manual override
- Settings (WAZ Subscription, cert, auto/manual, dashboard (on|off), etc)
- Triggers
- Schedule

== Scheduler ==
User needs a way to create custom rules on a schedule.

- New post type: wazScalerSchedule
- New post type should NOT be publicly viewable, but may be from the backend

Schedule items should include
- Time to execute
- Pulldown menu to (Scale In, Scale Out)
- Date rule becomes enabled
- Date rule becomes disabled

Could transients be used here to ensure these only get executed once?

Might it be possible to simply use the cron system completely for this?
- Prefix all rules
- To list rules
--- Pull all cron items from db
--- Filter out items that do not have the prefix
--- Display list
- Take a look at the MediaTemple cron UI for inspiration

== Handling Diagnostic Information ==
By default diagnostic information is stored in a table. This is awkward to use.
Since WordPress is using a database all the table entries should be pulled from
the table and stored in the database

*NOTE: Table here refers to a Windows Azure storage table, not a table in the database


== Cron Jobs ==
- (Every 5 minutes) Pull diagnostics from table and insert into database
- (Every 15 minutes) Retrieve diagnostics from db and check last 15 minutes against triggers
- Look at how the WP cron system works and possibly add scheduler items here
- Need to create custom cron hook that will add additional options http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_schedules

http://wpengineer.com/1908/use-wordpress-cron/

== Custom Post Types ==
- Custom rules scheduler (only if not using cron)
- Diagnostics information

== wp_options ==
For ease triggers could be stored as a JSON array, containing all the triggers.

Alternatively, if we want to make it easier for users to manipulate settings directly
from the database each setting could be stored as a seperate option

== Deactivate Code ==
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_deactivation_hook
Store deactivation code in decactivate.php

- Erase crons
- Remove diagnostics
- Remove settings? probably not

== Uninstall code ==
- Remove diagnostics
- Erase crons
- Remove settings

== Activation ==
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_activation_hook

- Pull crons from wp_options
- Create needed database tables

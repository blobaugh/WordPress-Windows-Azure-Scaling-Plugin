This plugin teaches Windows Azure how to properly scale your WordPress site

== Description ==
**NOTE:** The wp-admin interface for this plugin still needs some sprucing up. 
I (blobaugh) no longer have access to Windows Azure to continue improvement. If
you need this plugin consider contributing to it, or getting me another Windows
Azure subscription to continue development.

The Windows Azure cloud platform provides some very powerful scaling ability, 
however natively Windows Azure does not know how to scale applications. 
This plugin teaches WordPress how to scale your website on the Windows Azure 
platform and take advantage of the full power of the cloud.

= This plugin is not working for me! =

Apologies. More development work needs to be done, however I (blobaugh) no longer
have access to a Windows Azure subscription. If you would like to use this plugin
consider either contributing code to give it more awesome-sauce, or get me a
Windows Azure subscription that I can continue development with.
